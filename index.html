<h2>✨ About Me ✨</h2>
    <strong><p>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Basanta Thapa</span>, a dreamer from a middle-class family 🌟. Life hasn't been easy, but every challenge has taught me resilience and the power of self-growth 💪. As the only child in my family, I’ve taken it upon myself to break the cycle of poverty and build a better future 🌈.</p>
    <p>Turning 18 was a wake-up call 🔔. I realized that my habits—procrastination and being stuck on my phone 📱—were holding me back. So, I’m taking a <span class="highlight">30-day challenge</span> this December 🎯 to transform myself and get ready for an amazing <span class="highlight">2025</span> 🎉. This journey is about eliminating bad habits, learning new skills, and building a mindset for success 📚✨.</p>
    <p>Follow me as I document this challenge, share my progress, and inspire others to chase their dreams too 🚀. Together, let’s see how far we can go!</p></strong>
